Hannes, (Jeremy FYI),

The shower engineer came but the airlock seems to have cleared itself by the time he looked - it’s working now. The motor is working really hard because there is no real head/height of water from the tank level so run it as slow as you can to prolong the life of the motor. We mustn’t take the shower off the clip and lay it in the bath (even though you should be able to) because that is what drained the system and caused the problem. 

Blessings,

Peter
