    Stanford Machine Learning Exercises
    ===================================
    
These are the exercises for the Stanford Machine
Learning course on Coursera.
Here is the link for that course:

The exercises are all 100% correct. But they
are highly vectorised. So sometimes they might
be hard to understand.

The directory myClusterAlgorithm contains the 
cluster algorithm I developed myself. Unfortunately
it is not very efficient. It has a O(n^2) complexity.
